# Christmas 2025 Project
In the Philippines :philippines:, Christmas is usually the most awaited and favorite season of all time. Starting from September, the ambience transitions into a much jollier and brighter side with occassional Mariah Carey's hit _All I Want for Christmas Is You_ playing on the street. This light and invigorating spirit is what sets Filipino culture apart after having been in Europe for two years. Now, being able to return home with all the brand new and more reinforced knowledge I gathered from my master's studies, I encouraged my creativity to embark on a project that utilized the available electronics materials I had at hand. I intentionally finished this project right before Christmas time so I could run  it while we listened to Christmas songs on TV&ndash;which was a really exciting way to celebrate this season!
